        <p>
            I’m a Full-Stack developer with a strong motivation to grow and a
            solid foundation built through hands-on projects and completed
            courses. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working applications and
            continuously improving my skills by building, experimenting, and
            learning from practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience working across the full stack, with a primary
            focus on modern frontend technologies like React, Next.js, and
            Astro, as well as backend development with Node.js, Express, and
            MongoDB. Along the way, I’ve also gained practical exposure to
            Docker, basic CI/CD workflows, and cloud infrastructure concepts.
