    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I’m a Full-Stack developer with a strong motivation to grow and a solid
        foundation built through hands-on projects and completed courses. I
        enjoy turning ideas into real, working applications and continuously
        improving my skills by building, experimenting, and learning from
        practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have experience working across the full stack, with a primary focus on
        modern frontend technologies like React, Next.js, and Astro, as well as
        backend development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Along the way,
        I’ve also gained practical exposure to Docker, basic CI/CD workflows,
        and cloud infrastructure concepts.
